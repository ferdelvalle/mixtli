      Cloud Computing in Latin America</h1>

      <h1 class="text-title home-card-title">Background</h1>
      <p class="text-body" id="background-text">Cloud Computing is composed of several elements but at its core, as in any other kind of computing, we find Hardware and Software that work together. It works mostly using Representational State Transfer (REST) as an architectural style to provide services to a multitude of requests and responses through servers and clients.
        <br><br>
      The advantages of Cloud Computing have a meaningful impact on various organizations. Cloud computing processes do not only refer to the engineering of the technologies but also refers to the involvement of vendor partners and business leaders. Their involvement is not restricted to the business side of the Cloud, but their input is also crucial during the processes of designing those technologies.
        <br><br>
      Cloud services (including storage) play a key role in social and economic development, with direct and positive impacts on productivity, service availability or education, innovation, and improving access to information. All these benefits erode the traditional global barriers bringing people, businesses, NGOs, and governments closer than ever.
        <br><br>
      The adoption of the services cloud computing (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS) are growing rapidly and models of delivery or deployment of the cloud (private, public, hybrid, and community) offered by an endless supply of providers are beginning to be common in the terminology of business strategies and research centers.

      <h1 class="text-title home-card-title">Explanation</h1>
      <p class="text-body">The project presented is a result of the educational intervention proposal by a work team at UVEG. The main objective of the project is to investigate how Cloud Computing is understood and used in Latin America. Although Cloud Computing services are commonly, albeit often unknowingly, used by Latin Americans, on the corporate side, a considerable number of companies might be unaware of The Cloud as a business tool or might have a negative perception of it, with concerns about ease of implementation/migration and data safety. 
        <br><br>
      Though privately, streaming services and cloud storage (which rely on cloud computing services) are widely used in Latin America, companies still are reluctant to adopt Cloud Computing solutions. We aim to explore the factors that are responsible for hindering the acceptance of such effective technology. For which we will empirically examine if the reluctance is based on the lack of knowledge or reasons about trust and safety, due to behavioral aspects such as the force of habit.

      <h1 class="text-title home-card-title">Project viability</h1>
      <p class="text-body">As with any human endeavor, this project faces challenges but also holds certain advantages. 
        <br><br>
      The main threat to the project’s viability is the relatively short time window to work on it, which in turn requires pristine organizational and good communication skills that can be hindered by the complexities faced by any multi-time zone team.
        <br><br>
      That being said, the team counts among its members people with experience in research, data analysis and management, and cloud computing technologies.
        <br><br>
      Another fundamental advantage is that the project doesn’t aim to be the ultimate study about the Cloud in Latin America, but a foundation over which more focused studies can be designed.
        <br><br>
      Lastly, using good collaboration and communication tools, both for the project and for presenting the results, the whole project becomes not only easier to conduct, but also serves as an example of the advantages of using Cloud.

    <div class="cards home-item-large">
      <h1 class="text-title home-card-title">Originality and technical/scientific merit</h1>
      <p class="text-body">At the moment, there is limited data for Cloud usage in Latin America, and most of the existent information can be found within a very technical scope, while that might not be a problem for IT professionals, more often than not, the IT department has little to no decision power within most organizations.
      <br><br>
      This project aims to obtain current data, from the perspective of everyday employees and managers within the corporate world and, if possible, government.
      <br><br>
      Additionally, the Mixtli tool, developed for the project, makes use of commonly used pieces of tech, such as Google Sheets and forms, to serve as a very replicable example of how any group of students without a particularly high degree of technical proficiency can make their research projects and their results available online, keeping data updated automatically and involving little to no maintenance with excellent aesthetics and security.

    </div>
    <div class="cards home-item">
      <h1 class="text-title home-card-title">The risk associated with the project</h1>
      <p class="text-body">The biggest risk is not being able to acquire a sufficiently significant sample size, mostly due to the short duration of time. 
        <br><br>
      These time limitations might also mean that existing official data from some governments which are made available only on a request basis might have to be overlooked due to the lengthy time-windows of the protocols to make such requests.
        
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="cards home-item">
      <h1 class="text-title home-card-title">Methodology To achieve the objective</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Define the questions that need to be asked.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Design a survey to gather the information needed to answer the initial questions.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Make the survey available online so it can be shared through an URL.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Develop the tools to measure and analyze the data gathered by the survey.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Time permitting, conduct interviews with CTOs and CEOs.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Compile our results.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Make our results available through a website.</li>
        <br>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="cards home-item-large">
      <h1 class="text-title home-card-title">Description of the technical solution to the problem</h1>
      <p class="text-body">To put it in layman's terms, we implement a survey in the shape of an online form, and each time that survey is filled, it feeds an online spreadsheet. 
        <br><br>
      Within that online spreadsheet, using formulas, the data is analyzed, and that analyzed data is pulled by a website (made by the team for this project) that showcases the results in charts available in both English and Spanish (mixtli.info)
      <br><br>
      To achieve this, we use Zoho Forms, Google Sheets, and a run-of-the-mill cheap web-hosting service.
        <br><br>
      This is a simplification of the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture. In which the Model is replaced by a spreadsheet in Google Sheets, which is fed by a form (Zoho Forms) instead of using something more traditional like a SQL database.
        <br><br>
      The purpose of using Google Sheets as a database is to be able to replace the Controller, with formulas within the spreadsheet since it’s easier for the team to use those rather than a programming language for data analysis.
        <br><br>
      For the View, we use a Linux based web-hosting service with cPanel (commonly used for WordPress hosting) to deploy a rather simple website built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a little of jQuery (only for making the charts)
        <br><br>
      The resulting data from Google Sheets is exported as JSON and pulled by jQuery to render the charts using the FusionCharts library.
        <br><br>
      Every time the website loads, the charts present the most recent data in the charts without the need to manually update them at any time the source data changes. Consequently, each time a new survey is filled, that new data is automatically considered.
        <br><br>
      To comply with the Secure Sockets Layer standard, we used CloudFare’s DNS Name Servers to make use of their free SSL certificate.
        <br><br>
      It’s important to mention that this solution is designed to be as close to free as possible, easy to replicate, and simple to implement by people without a lot of dev experience. It is in no way the most efficient approach to be taken, but it’s easy to modify and replicate.
        <br><br>

      <h1 class="text-title home-card-title">Level of the impact of the innovation </h1>
      <p class="text-body">Cloud computing has a meaningful impact on various fronts: economic, social, industrial, etc. Since  the cloud is now present in our daily activities.
        <br>br

      The data gathered and presented by this project will present itself as a valuable resource for people incentivizing  companies to adopt a friendlier attitude towards the adoption of cloud computing solutions. 
        <br><br>
      It might also serve as a reference for further research related to cloud computing.
      </p>
      <h1 class="text-title home-card-title">Innovation</h1>
      <p>
      The main innovation of this project is to present the real numbers of companies, vendors, and IT providers that use cloud computing. It also looks at how many of these make the right use of cloud computing and how many are not familiar with this. This contributes to the overall understanding of the penetration levels, existing gaps, and the potential for use of technologies such as cloud computing. 
        <br><br>
      As an extra, the tool (website) developed to make research and data easily available online, can be replicated and makes research teams, capable of making their projects public online without having to spend part of their budgets and time into developing dedicated web-apps (and maintaining them)

      <h1 class="text-title home-card-title">Project requirements</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>A data gathering strategy (and the tools to gather it) is the project’s backbone.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Data analysis proficiency.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Development of means to present the results online and the means to deploy it.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Additionally, the team will be required to interact with employees and managers of a wide array of organizations to gather the data required by the project.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>It is paramount to obtain as much information as possible, hence the team will be required to cold contact some organizations if necessary.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li>Due to time restraints, an acceptable data pool will consist of at least fifty surveys filled by as many distinct organizations. Data redundancy must be avoided.</li>
